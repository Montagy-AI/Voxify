Cleanup script for orphaned voice clones.

This script removes voice clone records from the database that don't have
corresponding files in the file system, which can happen due to:
- Incomplete deletion operations
- Manual file system cleanup
- System crashes during deletion

Run this script to clean up inconsistent data between database and file system.
